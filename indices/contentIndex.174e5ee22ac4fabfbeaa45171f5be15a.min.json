To miss is a major sin (unless shariah permits an excuse)\n\t3. The reward for it is also [Qat'i](Usul%20Fiqh/Glossary/Qat'i.md)\n\t4. You must believe that it is fard\n\t5. Denial is kufr\n\t6. Example: Salah, it is proven from the Qur'an, and the reward is proven from the Qur'an\n\t7. There are some faraa'id that the scholars differ upon, this is called fard 'amali, you must believe in it, however the performing it is differed upon\n2. Wajib\n\t1. It is also lazim - obligatory, proven from a daleel [Dhannee](Usul%20Fiqh/Glossary/Dhannee.md)\n\t2. To not do it is makruh tahrimi and a minor sin\n\t3. Persistence upon it becomes a major sin\n\t4. Its reward is evident from daleel [Dhannee](Usul%20Fiqh/Glossary/Dhannee.md), and therefore not lazim to believe in it\n\t5.

Wajib is something the Prophet ﷺ did all His life, and mentioned a punishment for not doing it\n\t\t2. Sunnah mu'akkadah is something the Prophet ﷺ did all His life, and did not mentioned a punishment for not doing it\n3. Sunnah\n\t1. There are 2 types of sunnahs:\n\t\t1. Sunan ul-hudaa i.e. sunnah mu'akkadah (emphasised)\n\t\t\t1. To do it is rewarding, to not do it *can* become sinful\n\t\t\t2. The ahnaaf believe that consistently missing them will deprive one of the intercession of the Prophet ﷺ\n\t\t\t3. It is something that the Prophet ﷺ did all his lifetime as a form of worship\n\t\t\t4. Example: Adhaan, Iqamah\n\t\t3. Sunan zaa'idah i.e. sunnah ghayr mu'akkadah (non emphasised)\n\t\t\t1. Actions of the Prophet ﷺ done habitually, and not as a form of worship\n4. Nafl\n\t1. To do it is rewarding with the correct intention\n\t2. To miss it, is not a sin, nor is he condemned on the day of judgement\n\t3. It is any amr that is additional to fard and wajib which the shariah has permitted\n\t4.
