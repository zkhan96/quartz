Kitab-ullah: 500+ ayaat relating to ahkam\n2. Sunnatu-rasooli: An Action of the Prophet (s.a.w.) - Sunnah is used as an action can never be [maudoo](Hadith/maudoo.md)\n\n### From Dala'il Ghayr Sam'iyyah:\n3. Ijma' - starting from ijma' of the sahabah\n4. Qiyas\n\n## Evidences, and their Breakdown\n\nTerminology: [Qat'i](Usul%20Fiqh/Glossary/Qat'i.md), [Dhannee](Usul%20Fiqh/Glossary/Dhannee.md), [At-thuboot](Usul%20Fiqh/Glossary/At-thuboot.md), [Ad-dalalah](Usul%20Fiqh/Glossary/Ad-dalalah.md)\n\n## Qat'i At-thuboot and Qat'i Ad-dalalah\n- The evidence being used is irrefutably authentic i.e. [mutawatir](Usul%20Fiqh/Glossary/mutawatir.md), and the meaning of the evidence is irrefutably clear.\n\n### Hukm\n- You can prove fardh and haraam with it and there is no dispute amongst the scholars regarding it.\n\n### Example\n- Establishment of the prayer.\n\n## Qat'i At-thuboot and Dhannee Ad-dalalah\n- The evidence being used is irrefutably authentic i.e. [mutawatir](Usul%20Fiqh/Glossary/mutawatir.md), and the meaning of the evidence is disputed among scholars.\n\n### Hukm\n- #todo \n\n### Example:\n- When a divorcee has to wait three cycles (thalathata Quroo') which is established from Qur'an. However, does Quroo' here mean a period of purity or impurity?\n\n## Dhannee At-thuboot and Qat'i Ad-dalalah\n- The evidence is a khabr wahid, but the matn is undisputed.\n\n### Hukm\n- You cannot prove a fardh from it, however, you can prove wajib, down to makruh tahrimi.\n\n### Example \n- Every action is upon its intention\n\n## Dhannee At-thuboot and Dhannee Ad-dalalah\n- The evidence is a [khabr wahid](Hadith/khabr%20wahid.md), and the meaning of the evidence is disputed among scholars.\n\n### Hukm\n- You can only prove mustahabb down to makruh tanzihi.\n\n### Example:\n- Drinking milk \u0026 washing the mouth.","lastmodified":"2023-06-22T00:44:45.918487526Z","tags":[]},"/Usul-Fiqh/Quranic-words/Aam":{"title":"Aam","content":"\n\u003e 'Alaa sabeeli ijtimaa: It is inclusive to many meanings\n\nThis is a diagram that summarises Aam: ![aam diagram](Usul%20Fiqh/Quranic%20words/aam%20diagram.png)\n\n\n- Aam is divided into 2 types:\n\t- Khussa 'anhu shay' [tawbah:5-6](https://quran.com/9?startingVerse=6) - Specified to the warzone only\n\t- Lam yukhassa 'anhu shay' [tawbah:100](https://quran.com/9?startingVerse=100)  - All of the ansar are included, they are not limited\n\nThe meaning of a khas term can be repealed by an aam.","lastmodified":"2023-06-22T00:44:45.926487703Z","tags":[]},"/Usul-Fiqh/Quranic-words/Khas":{"title":"Khas","content":"\nTranslation: Specific\n\n## There are 3 types of Khas\n\n\n### Khasul fard\n- A word used for a specific reason, or one person\n- [Qat'i](Usul%20Fiqh/Glossary/Qat'i.md) and yaqeeni\n- Nobody can be added to its understanding\n\n### Khasul naw'\n- Specific to one type i.e. the male gender\n- This is [Dhannee](Usul%20Fiqh/Glossary/Dhannee.md) [At-thuboot](Usul%20Fiqh/Glossary/At-thuboot.md) i.e. [khabr wahid](Hadith/khabr%20wahid.md)\n\n### Khasul jins\n- Everything within a category i.e. insan\n\n## When Khas contradicts a khabr wahid\nHukm of wudoo' are Khas in the Qur'an.
