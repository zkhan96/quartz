title: "Baqarah 150-152"

Allah says to turn towards the new qiblah so that the enemies of Allah are not left with any hijjah (evidence) against them. This evidence being that the jews also worship towards masjid aqsa. This left them with no evidence against them. And the mushrikeen would say the Muslims believe in the prophethood of Ibrahim a.s. So why do you not face the Ka'bah?

Those that werent willing to accept were not going to accept anyway. So Allah says do not fear them, but fear Me instead.

The Prophet ï·º was prophesised to be the imam of two qiblahs. This was the ni'mah of Allah to complete.

Allah says, exhalted is He, that if you remember Me, I will remember you. By remembering, it is meant that Allah will mention us in the company of the angels.
