title: "Baqarah 142-143"

The qibla was changed 16 months after hijrah. Allah says that the Jews will say the Muslims always oppose us. So he informed the Prophet ﷺ to say to them for Allah is the east and the west. 

Ummatan wasataa: the best. The middle is seen as the best I.e. between youth and old, the middle is the best. In that same way, we are a middle ummah. Islam’s rulings aren’t too strict nor too soft.

On the day of qiyamah, the previous nations will say no prophet came to us. But in this ummah, the sahabah, tabi'een etc will say the kuffar are wrong as every prophet have completed their duty. The kuffar will say how can those that were absent bear witness against us? Then the Prophet ﷺ will say he told our ummah.

The qiblah changed during salah. Many hypocrites apostated. 

It was a heavy thing to accept. And those who believed, Allah promises that their imaan will not go to waste. The sahabah asked regarding those who died before the changing of the qiblah that will their salah go to waste. And Allah reaffirms that it will not be wasted.
