## What is Usul Fiqh?
- It is a set of principles that allows you to derive rulings from their evidences
- The ahnaf were the first to establish usul
- In the past, scholars did not require them to be documented

## The principles of Fiqh are 4:

### From Dala'il Sam'iyyah:

1. Kitab-ullah: 500+ ayaat relating to ahkam
2. Sunnatu-rasooli: An Action of the Prophet (s.a.w.) - Sunnah is used as an action can never be [maudoo](Hadith/maudoo.md)

### From Dala'il Ghayr Sam'iyyah:
3. Ijma' - starting from ijma' of the sahabah
4. Qiyas

## Evidences, and their Breakdown

Terminology: [Qat'i](Usul%20Fiqh/Glossary/Qat'i.md), [Dhannee](Usul%20Fiqh/Glossary/Dhannee.md), [At-thuboot](Usul%20Fiqh/Glossary/At-thuboot.md), [Ad-dalalah](Usul%20Fiqh/Glossary/Ad-dalalah.md)

## Qat'i At-thuboot and Qat'i Ad-dalalah
- The evidence being used is irrefutably authentic i.e. [Mutawatir](Usul%20Fiqh/Glossary/Mutawatir.md), and the meaning of the evidence is irrefutably clear.

### Example:
- When a divorcee has to wait three cycles (thalathata Quroo') which is established from Qur'an. However, does Quroo' here mean a period of purity or impurity?
