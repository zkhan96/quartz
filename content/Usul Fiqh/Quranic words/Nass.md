## Definition
Theres a different between [Dhahir](Usul%20Fiqh/Quranic%20words/Dhahir.md) and nass. The mujtahid would use the support of a daleel to ascertain the dhahir meaning.

Nass is when it is dhahir, but it requires a bit of justification using daleel.

Dhahir does not require the intention of the speaker, but nass requires some information about the intention.

## Example
The ayah for marrying multiple, it makes permissible marrying multiple, the nass principle applied is that there is a limit that Allah has set for the number of women you can marry.

The dhahir meaning is marry more than one
The nass meaning is marry maximum 4
