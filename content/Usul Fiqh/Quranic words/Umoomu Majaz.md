title: "Umoomu Majaz"
---
## Definition
- Diverting from the literal meaning, towards the culturally understood and accepted meaning.
- Umoom: comes from aam. In other words; what the general society deem acceptable.

When somebody swears by Allah that they will not enter somebody’s house, societal norms would say that you’d typically step your foot into the home. If you took it literally, I.e. haqiqah muta’addhirah, you could be talking about the skin of your foot touching the home. But societal norm wouldn’t fit this.
