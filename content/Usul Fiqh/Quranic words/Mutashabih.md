## Definition
There is even more ambiguity than [Mujmal](Usul%20Fiqh/Quranic%20words/Mujmal.md). When there is so much ambiguity, that there is no understanding them and there is no room for elaboration.

## Example
The mutashaabihaat ayaat. e.g. The ayah of istiwaa. There is no understanding in there for us.

## Example
The huroof muqatta'aat.

## Hukm
Is it not ja'iz for a [mukallaf](Usul%20Fiqh/Glossary/mukallaf.md) to question or want more information.
