title: "Khas"
---

Translation: Specific

## There are 3 types of Khas

### Khasul fard
- A word used for a specific reason, or one person
- [Qat'i](Usul%20Fiqh/Glossary/Qat'i.md) and yaqeeni
- Nobody can be added to its understanding

### Khasul naw
- Specific to one type i.e. the male gender
- This is [Dhannee](Usul%20Fiqh/Glossary/Dhannee.md) [At-thuboot](Usul%20Fiqh/Glossary/At-thuboot.md) i.e. [khabr wahid](Hadith/khabr%20wahid.md)

### Khasul jins
- Everything within a category i.e. insan

## When Khas contradicts a khabr wahid
Hukm of wudoo' are Khas in the Qur'an. However, [Imam Shafi'i](Ilmul%20rijaal/Imam%20Shafi'i.md) says that niyyah is fard which isnt mentioned in the Qur'an.

## The Response from the Ahnaf
Rather than refuting at first, we try to reconcile between the evidences. So in the case where the niyyah Hadith needs to be reconciled, the Ahnaf say that niyyah is mustahabb, but it is not wajib.
