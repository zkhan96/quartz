## Definition
Mufassar is such that in the time of the Prophet ﷺ, it could be abrogated, but muhkam, even at the time of the Prophet ﷺ, leaves no room for [naskh](Usul%20Fiqh/Glossary/naskh.md)

There are types of Muhkam:
1. Muhkam li'aynihi: This is the highest form of evidence, such as Allah describing of the [dhaat](Usul%20Fiqh/Glossary/dhaat.md) and sifaat of Allah 
2. Muhkam lighayrihi: That evidence which had been abrogated in the past. Example: The ayah not to go near Salah whilst you are intoxicated [Nisa:43](https://quran.com/4?startingVerse=43)
