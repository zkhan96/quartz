title: "Mushtarak"
---
## Definition
It can potentially cater for many things in its meaning. This is the difference between [Aam](Usul%20Fiqh/Quranic%20words/Aam.md) and this. It has the capacity for many but does not.

I.e. Muslimoon. It is a term referring to all Muslims, but under certain contexts, it is used for a subset, or a particular group, depending on the context it is used.

Mushtarak is of 2 types:
1. Ishtiraak lafdhee: E.g. ayn which can mean gold, eye, etc. a homonym. E.g. row, which has many meanings
2. Ishtiraak ma'nawi: It is understood by its use. I.e. when you use the term insaan, you are by extension saying an intelligent animal 

### Example of Umoom mushtarak
- Ayah of durood: [Ahzab:56](https://quran.com/33?startingVerse=56)
	- When we say salawat, it is to send dua of rahmah
	- When Allah says he sends salawat, it is to send rahmah itself
