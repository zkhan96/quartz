title: "Mujmal"

## Definition
Mujmal comprises of both [Khafiy](Usul%20Fiqh/Quranic%20words/Khafiy.md) and [Mushkil](Usul%20Fiqh/Quranic%20words/Mushkil.md) because using common sense, you can never get to the true understanding. It requires expert opinion to help you understand the meaning.

All actions of two types:
1. Af'aal hissiyyah: Ahkam that started before the Prophet's ﷺ birth and continued thereafter. Such as zina being wrong
2. Af'aal shar'iyyah: Ahkam that were codified by the Prophet ﷺ. Such as nikah, zakah, hajj


Mujmal is all to do with Af'aal shar'iyyah. As we want to get to the true meaning through sound understanding. Mujmal can only be understood once the shaari' has explained it.

## Example
The ayah of Transactions made halal for you, but riba has been made haram.

Ribaa literally means profit. At face value, this would not make sense. So one has to return to the shaari' (i.e. The Prophet ﷺ) to explain the ayah. To not sell gold for gold, silver for silver, wheat for wheat etc except that they have to be equal.
