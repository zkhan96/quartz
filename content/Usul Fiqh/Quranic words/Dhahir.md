## Definition
Apparent

Its so obvious it does not demand further elaboration or understanding. When you use that word, the listener know exactly what you intended.

## Example
Allah says in the Qur'an, to marry 2, 3 or 4. But if you cant do justice, then one.

If you fear you cannot do justice, the implied meaning is clear that if you cannot be just in fulfilling their rights between them, then marry only one woman.

## Example 2
Im the Quran: A Muhrim goes to hajj, when you come out ihram, you slaughter an animal
