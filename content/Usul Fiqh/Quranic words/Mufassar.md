title: "Mufassar"
---
## Definition 
Explained

When something is [Dhahir](Usul%20Fiqh/Quranic%20words/Dhahir.md), but the speaker gives a further elaboration on what he said.

## Example
The angels prostrated, all of them together.

The second statement uses the word "kulluhum". There is no room for any angel to be missed out. Without the elaboration, someone could cast doubt on whether it was all angels or not.

## Difference between nass and mufassar
In [Nass](Usul%20Fiqh/Quranic%20words/Nass.md), an external explanation was required, in mufassar, the speaker himself has elaborated, so it is a step more accurate in its true meaning.

A mufassar statement is dhahir and nass as well.

## Difference between tafseer and ta'weel
Tafseer is elaboration
Ta'weel is when you divert the meaning to something else provided you have evidence to prove this
