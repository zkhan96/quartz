title: "Majaz"
---
## Definition
The opposite of [Haqiqah](Usul%20Fiqh/Quranic%20words/Haqiqah.md), it is the metaphorical meaning.

The ahnaf and the shafi'is say that haqiqah and majaz come together under certain criteria:
1. When same word has been used
2. The word has been used at the same time
3. It has to be intended for both haqiqah and majaz meanings
The ahnaf say this is a valid use case. If you dont intend for both of them, then it will be only one or the other 

## Example
- You give a ba'in divorce, an implied non explicit one e.g. a man says to his wife, get out
- The imam will ask did you mean, get out of the house? Or did you mean divorce?
- Depending on the answer, the divorce will be applied

## Hukm
The ahnaf say that both haqiqah and majaz can happen in one statement.

Ijtimaau Did-dayn: coming together of opposites. This is impossible, such as black and white, they cannot be together

Going back to the example of thalathata quroo. As it cannot be both hayd and tuhr at the same time.
