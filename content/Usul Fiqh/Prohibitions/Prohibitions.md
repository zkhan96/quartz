It is also under sabeelil isti'la: when a higher authority says to someone of lower authority to not do such and such.

Nahee: it is a demand for not doing of an action


The one demanding is called a naahi
The one being demanded is a manhee

### Whats the difference between a nahi and a nafee?
A nahi is a command and a nafee is a khabr, you are informing someone.

A nahi is that regardless of Allah and his Prophet ﷺ are you still able to execute such an action? If so, then it is a nahi. And if its not possible to do it then its a nafee

### Example
Allah says in the Quran not to commit zina, and a person commits zina anyway. There is a nahi in place and the person was able to do it, therefore it is considered a nahi

### Example 2
Allah and His Prophet ﷺ say not to marry your mahram. And a man marries his mother anyway. This was a nafee, as this is impossible in shari'ah and its not a valid act.

So why is a nahi qabeeh (detested)?

There are two types of qabeeh:
1. Qabeeh li'aynihi: for example zina; it is intrinsically wrong, universally immoral
2. Qabeeh lighayrihi: when it is detested for external factors, for example, fasting on the day of eid. Intrinsically, fasting is good, but there is external factors such as ahadith that the act is prohibited and detested

Qabeeh lighayrihi has two types:
1. Wasfan: A hadith prohibiting you from transacting in alcohol. Alcohol is of value, the qabeeh lighayrihi is that transacting with it is prohibited
3. Majaazan: transaction on the day of jummah en route to jummah prayer. once the second adhan happens, to seize trading after the second adhan
