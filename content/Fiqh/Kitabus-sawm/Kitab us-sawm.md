The coming of the second twilight is when fajr begins and the time for fasting begins. In high latitude locatinons, there are 4 ways to calculate fajr:
1. Aqranul ayyam: the last day you saw the time of fajr
2. Nisful layl: you split the night into two parts, first is isha, second is fajr
3. Subhul layl: you distribute the night into 7 parts and the last part is fajr 
4. Aqrabul bilaad: the closest city that has a proper fajr and isha

- Taking in steam will break the fast.
- Masturbation breaks the fast, but no kaffaarah. However, the ulema say that if one is a repeat offender, he has to pay kaffaarah, as he has achieved full satisfaction. Mufti akmals opinion.

If someone eats or drinks during the fast, there is dispute whether there is kaffarah. Imam [Abu hanifah](Ilmul%20rijaal/Abu%20hanifah.md) says that there is qadaa and kaffarah.
