[[Imam Shurunbulali]] says there are 7 types of water that are clean:
- Rainwater
	- Why is rainwater from the waters that are clean? Because it is from a [Muhkam](Usul%20Fiqh/Quranic%20words/Muhkam.md) verse
- Seawater
	- In a hadith, we are permitted 2 things that we do not need to mention the name of Allah - Fish and locusts.
- River water
	- E.g. The nile, the euphrates river. Because it is water that is in a flowing state and therefore it cannot be contaminated with impurity
- Well water
	- If it is smaller than a 10x10m  (typical size) and is not impure, or if its larger
- Water melted from snow
- Hail water
- Spring water
#### The General principle
There is an easier way to memorise the types of water. Everything that is called water is correct to be used to cleaning.

E.g. Tea is not called water, its called tea because the tea dominates the water

### The categories of water
1. Pure and purifying:  pure, unrestricted water
2. Pure and purifying, but disliked: water that a cat or similar has drunk, and amount is small (there is debate whether this is makruh tahrimi or tanzihi, but tanzihi is dominant)
3. Pure but not purifying (maa-ul musta'mal): water that has been used to remove an impurity ([[hadath]]) or for [[ghusl]]
4. Impure water
5. Water that is doubted for cleanliness
