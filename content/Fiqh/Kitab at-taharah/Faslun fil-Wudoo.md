Wudoo is built up of 4 pillars:
1. Washing the face - from the top of the forehead where the hair starts and down to the chin bone.
2. Washing the hands including the wrist bone. Imam Abu Yusuf differed on this and did not include the wrist or the ankle but this is a minority opinion.
3. Washing the feet up to and including the heels. Including the ankle is good to wash. Imam Abu Yusuf does not include the heels either
4. Rubbing with water of at least a quarter of the head. It is better to go over the whole of the head out of precaution. Hasan al Basri would say it is required to do the full head.
